# Stockinator
A Multiplatform Stock Market Analysis Platform!

## Story and Concept
The Stockinator project began as a result of a Project Mgmt class - initially designed to be a desktop application to function as a stock screening tool, it has now expanded to possibly implement a web app with the same purpose.

## What is a Stock Screener?
A stock screener is a tool designed to screen for stocks using any parameters you wish to define. It allows decision-making using data. Even if you don't know much about stocks, it should be easy to understand why it's so useful to use them.

## Project Details
Stockinator is currently working using a Electron/React frontend that pulls data from a simple backend designed using Python/FastAPI and that is currently hosted in [Heroku](https://stockinator-data.herokuapp.com/stock/MSFT). The choice for a JavaScript framework was to allow easy migration for both mobile and web environments.

This project is now a part of the DevScript Winter of Code 2020, and it is open for contributions!
